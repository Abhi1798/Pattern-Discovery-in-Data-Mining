Question Explanation

The correct answer is: "1". 

The lift can be calculated by 



where supp(A) and supp(B) refer to the relative support of A and B respectively. Thus,

χ2 can be evaluated as follows 



where Oi is the observed frequency, and Ei is the expected frequency. Since the expected values equal the observed ones, we have χ2 = 0.

Question Explanation

The correct answer is: "l1 ≠ l2, k1 = k2". 

Lift is not null invariant and therefore sensitive to the number of null transactions, while Kulcyzynski is null invariant.
Question 6
A store had 100,000 total transactions in Q4 2014. 10,000 transactions contained eggs, while 5,000 contained bacon. 2000 transactions contained both eggs and bacon.

The correct answer is "0.5". 



For a pattern to be considered a negative pattern, it must have a value

Given the itemsets in Table 1, which of the following patterns are in the δ-cluster containing the pattern {A, C, E, S} for δ = 0.0001?

The correct answer is: "{F, A, C, E, S}". 

All the other patterns have a distance greater than δ from the pattern {A, C, E, S}.
Question 8


Given the transactions in Table 2, which of the following is true? Select all that apply.
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
(abe) is a (2, 0.5)-robust pattern	Inorrect	0.00	
(f) is a 0.5-core pattern of (bcf)	Correct	0.20	
(ac) is a 0.5-core pattern of (abcef)	Correct	0.20	
(a) is a 0.5-core pattern of (abe)	Correct	0.20	
(abcef) is a (3, 0.5)-robust pattern	Correct	0.20	
Total		0.80 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

The correct answers are: "(abe) is a (2, 0.5)-robust pattern", "(ac) is a 0.5-core pattern of (abcef)", "(a) is a 0.5-core pattern of (abe)", and "(f) is a 0.5-core pattern of (bcf)". 

Since (e) is still a 0.5-core pattern of (abe), (abe) is a (2, 0.5)-robust pattern. By the same token, (abcef) is a (4, 0.5)-robust pattern, not a (3, 0.5)-robust pattern. (ac) is a 0.5-core pattern of (abcef) since only one other pattern contains (ac). (a) is a 0.5-core pattern of (abe) since it has a core ratio of 2/3. By the same token, (f) is a 0.5-core pattern of (bcf).
Question 9
A constraint is anti-monotone if an itemset S violates the constraint, so do all of its supersets. Which of following constraints is anti-monotone?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
Relative support of S > 0.3	Correct	1.00	
avg(S.price) < 10			
range(S.price) > 10			
sum(S.price) > 25			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

The correct answer is: "Relative support of S > 0.3"

Suppose X is the superset of S; if so, the following inequalities always hold for all X:

Relative support of X ≤ Relative support of S
sum(X.price) ≥ sum(S.price)
avg(X.price) <> avg(S.price)
range(X.price) ≥ range(S.price)
From these inequalities, we can easily verify that relative support of S > 0.3 is anti-monotone.

Question 10
A constraint is monotone if an itemset S satisfies the constraint, so do all of its supersets. Which of following constraints is monotone?
Your Answer		Score	Explanation
sum(S.price) > 20	Correct	1.00	
avg(S.price) < 10			
min(S.price) > 10			
Support of S > 100			
Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

The correct answer is: "sum(S.price) > 20"

Suppose X is the superset of S; if so, the following inequalities always hold for all X:

support of X ≤ support of S
min(X.price) ≤ min(S.price)
avg(X.price) <> avg(S.price)
sum(X.price) ≥ sum(S.price)
From these inequalities, we can easily verify that sum(S.price) > 20 is monotone.
