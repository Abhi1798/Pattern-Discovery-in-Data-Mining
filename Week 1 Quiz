Table 1: Transactions from a database.


Given the transactions in Table 1, minsup s = 50%, and minconf c = 50%, which of the following is not a frequent itemset?

{Beer}	Correct	0.20	
Total		0.80 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

The correct answers are: "{Coffee}", "{Nuts, Eggs, Milk}", and "{Beer, Eggs}". 

We only need to compute the support for each itemset since minconf only applies to association rules. 

{Beer} has support 4⁄5
{Coffee} has support 2⁄5
{Beer, Diaper} has support 3⁄5
{Nuts, Eggs, Milk} has support 2⁄5
{Beer, Eggs} has support 2⁄5

Given the transactions in Table 1, what is the confidence and relative support of the association rule {Diaper} ⇒ {Coffee, Nuts}?

Question Explanation

The correct answer is: "support s = 0.4, confidence c = 0.5"
Question 4
Consider the database containing the transaction T1 : {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}, T2 : {a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}. Let minsup = 1. Which of the following is a closed frequent pattern? Select all that apply.

{a2, a3, a4, a5}	Correct	0.20

Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

The correct answers are: "{a2, a3, a4, a5}", "{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}", and "{a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}". 

"{a2, a5}" and "{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}" are not closed frequent patterns because "{a2, a3, a4, a5}" is a super patter of "{a2, a5}" with the same support and "{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}" has support 0, hence not a frequent pattern given minsup = 1.
Question 5
Consider the database containing the transactions T1 : {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}, T2 : {a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}. Let minsup = 1. Which of the following is both a max frequent and a closed frequent pattern? Select all that apply.

Total		1.00 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

The correct answers are: "{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}" and "{a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}". 

Since "{a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}" and "{a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}" are frequent super patterns of "{a2, a5}" and "{a2, a3, a4, a5}", and "{a2, a5}" and "{a2, a3, a4, a5}" cannot be max frequent patterns. "{a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}" has support 0, hence it is not a frequent pattern.

recover all transactions in the database.	Correct	0.25	
recover the set of all frequent patterns and their support in some situations but not all.	Inorrect	0.00	
Total		0.50 / 1.00	
Question Explanation

The correct answers are: "always recover the set of all frequent patterns and their support." and "find the set of max frequent patterns.". 

Since closed frequent patterns are a lossless compression of frequent patterns, "always recover the set of all frequent patterns and their support." is always achievable. We can remove all patterns that have a super pattern in the set of closed frequent patterns to find the set of max frequent patterns, hence "find the set of max frequent patterns." is always achievable.
Question 7

Question Explanation

The correct answers are: "9" and "10". 

The support of {a, b, c} should be no more than 10, which is the support of the {a, b}.
Question 8
If we know the support of itemset {a} is 50, and the support of itemset {a, b, c} is 10, which of the following numbers are the possible supports of itemset {a, b}?

Question Explanation

The correct answers are: "50", "30", "10". 

The support of {a, b} should be between the supports of {a} and {a, b, c}, i.e. ∈ [10, 50].
Question 9
Considering Apriori Algorithm, assume we have 5 items (A to E) in total. In the 1-st scan, we find out all frequent items A, B, C, and E. How many size-2 (i.e. containing 2 items, e.g. A, B) itemsets should be considered in 2-nd scan, i.e. are potential to be size-2 frequent itemsets?

Question Explanation

The correct answers are: "{c, a, m, p} : 2", "{c, a, b, m} : 1", and "{b} : 1". 

f-conditional database in the example is actually as same as the subtree of the only node f.
